# Smart Stormwater SWMM Models
This is a repository for storing EPASWMM5 ([Environmental Protection Agency Stormwater Management Model](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/storm-water-management-model-swmm)) models used for studying the potential for active stormwater control in mitigating flooding. We are particularly interested in coastal flooding and the Hague model is a model in Norfolk, Virginia USA, a very flood-prone coastal city.
